        This website is a demo using CSS and HTMLand is proof of my knowledge of these programming languages.
        I made this website as part of the final week on my CodeNation course as a final project.
        I think despite being very simple in design, it is a clean example of a professional portfolio without the use of JavaScript. <br> <br>
        When I started this course I couldn't code at all. However, with the patience of
        Dan and a great week 2 team project I started to fall in love with coding. 
        I have grown over the course and have thoroughly enjoyed pushing myself to try and create the best work I possibly can.
        I never would have dreamed that I could improve so much so fast. <br> <br>
        Thank you to everyone who helped me and motivated me to push myself.
